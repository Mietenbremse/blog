All Berlin districts offer free tenant counselling that all residents of the district can use. It's best to print out your results and bring them with you to the counselling service. The tenancy law experts can give you an assessment of your result and advise you on the next steps.  
 You can find an overview of the counselling services in the districts here: [https://www.berlin.de/sen/wohnen/service/serviceadressen/mieterberatungen-in-den-bezirken/](https://www.berlin.de/sen/wohnen/service/serviceadressen/mieterberatungen-in-den-bezirken/￼)

 You bear the risk if you lose and don't have legal expenses insurance to cover the costs. Here we have created an overview of the costs that could arise.  
 Together with specialised lawyers, we have prepared detailed instructions with all the necessary documents.

You can help to ensure that fewer people pay too much rent. When we join forces, we are stronger:  
     - Inform your neighbours if your rent is too high. It's likely that your neighbours feel the same way. Many don't know that they can take action against high rents. We have some ideas for you on how you can inform your neighbours and network with them. You can put up notices in the hallway, put flyers in the letterbox or invite them to a tenants' meeting.

- Raise awareness of the rent crisis: share with your friends and acquaintances how outrageously high your rent is. With our sharepics, you can inform your family, friends and acquaintances about [mietencheck.de](http://mietencheck.de) and invite them to join you.  
     - Many tenants have already joined forces to defend themselves against cheeky landlords. If you live with a large housing company, there may already be others who are fighting against the rent crisis. We are always happy to welcome new comrades!
